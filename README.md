## Project Description: Streamlining Payment Processing with Domain-Driven Design, Hexagonal Architecture, and Kafka Streams

This project demonstrates a simplified payment processing use case implemented with a focus on modern architectural patterns and best practices. It showcases how to leverage:

* **Domain-Driven Design (DDD):**  The core domain logic of payment processing is encapsulated within a well-defined domain model, ensuring clarity and maintainability.
* **Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters):**  The application is structured around use cases, with clear separation of concerns between core logic and external infrastructure (databases, message queues, etc.). This promotes flexibility and testability.
* **Kafka Streams:** By utilizing Kafka Streams for stateful stream processing, we eliminate the need for a traditional "outbox" table in our saga-based payment orchestration. This simplifies the architecture and improves performance.

**Key Features and Benefits:**

* **Simplified Saga Implementation:** Kafka Streams allows us to manage saga state and orchestrate the payment workflow directly within the stream processing pipeline, removing the complexity of an external outbox table.
* **Improved Performance:** Eliminating database interactions for saga management reduces latency and enhances overall system throughput.
* **Enhanced Scalability:** Kafka's inherent scalability ensures the payment processing system can handle increasing transaction volumes.
* **Increased Resilience:** Kafka's fault-tolerance mechanisms contribute to a more robust and reliable payment processing flow.
* **Clear and Maintainable Code:** DDD and Hexagonal Architecture principles promote clean code organization and separation of concerns, making the project easier to understand, maintain, and evolve.

**Use Case:**

The project implements a simplified payment process involving the following steps:

1. **Order Creation:** An order is placed, triggering the payment process.
2. **Payment Authorization:** The payment gateway is contacted to authorize the payment.
3. **Funds Reservation:** Funds are reserved on the customer's account.
4. **Order Confirmation:** Upon successful payment authorization and reservation, the order is confirmed.
5. **Inventory Update:**  Inventory is updated to reflect the fulfilled order.
6. **Shipping:** The order is shipped to the customer.

**Technology Stack:**

* **Programming Language:** JAVA 23
* **Framework:** TO BE DEFINED 
* **Messaging:** Apache Kafka with Kafka Streams
* **Database:** POSTGRESS
* **Testing:** JUNIT MOCKITO SPRING 

This project serves as a practical example of how to combine DDD, Hexagonal Architecture, and Kafka Streams to build a modern, efficient, and scalable payment processing system. It provides a valuable learning resource for developers interested in implementing similar solutions.
